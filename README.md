# Yummy
A Single Screen App "Yummy" is the first project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree

## Project Overview
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

##Suggested App Ideas
Details about a small business in your neighborhood
Contact info and description about your workplace or school
Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) you’re part of and how new members can sign up
Requirements
Your design must include:

Business name
At least one photo representing the business
Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
Address of the Business
Description of business
Hours of operation
Note: This is not required but If you’re up for a making real impact in your community, go check out an actual local business and obtain their consent to build an app for them!

### Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
